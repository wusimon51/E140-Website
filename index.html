						<h2 style="text-transform: none;">Case 1: Rambert, <em>The Plague</em></h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						His name was Raymond Rambert.
						<br>
						Short, square-shouldered, with a determined-looking face and keen, intelligent eyes, he gave the impression of someone who could
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">keep his end up in any circumstances.</span>
						(5)
					</section>
					<section>
						...sometimes you encountered Rambert, the journalist, looking interested as ever in all he saw. (32)
					</section>
					<section>
						"So they've got alarmed at last." The telegram ran: Proclaim a state of plague stop
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">close the town.</span>
						(32)
					</section>
					<section>
						And though the narrator experienced only the common form of exile, he cannot forget the case of those who,
						like <span class="fragment highlight-green">Rambert the journalist</span> and a good many others, had to endure an aggravated deprivation, since,
						being travelers caught by the plague and forced to stay where they were,
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">
							they were cut off both from
							the person with whom they wanted to be and from their homes as well.
						</span>
						(36)
					</section>
					<section>
						Rambert talked incessantly, as if his nerves were out of hand.
						<br>
						He had left his wife in Paris, he said. (41)
					</section>
					<section>
						His impression then was that this state of things was quite temporary, and all he'd tried to
						do was to get a letter through to her. But the post-office officials had
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">
							vetoed
						</span>
						this, his colleagues of the local press said they could do nothing for him, and a clerk in the
						Prefect's office had
						<span class="fragment highlight-red">
							laughed in his face.
						</span>
						(41)
					</section>
					<section>
						He'd decided to leave the town at once.
						The official told him he quite appreciated his position, but
						<u class="fragment">
							no exceptions could be made.

						"But, confound it," Rambert exclaimed, "I don't belong here!" (41)

						It was a period of <span class="fragment highlight-blue">sheer lethargy.</span> He had gone the round of offices, taken every step that
						could be taken, and realized that for the present all avenues of that kind were closed to him.
						So now he <span class="fragment highlight-blue">drifted aimlessly</span> from cafe to cafe. In the mornings he would sit on the terrace of
						one of them and read a newspaper in the hope of finding some indication that the epidemic was on the wane.
						(53)
					</section>
					<section>
						Seated in the empty cafe, Rambert looked <span class="fragment highlight-blue">pathetically lost,</span> a mere shade among the shadows,
						and Rieux guessed this was the hour when he felt most derelict. (54)
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Once assured that there was no way of getting out of the town by <span

						I had the scholarship of Philomena Guinea, a wealthy novelist who went to my college i
